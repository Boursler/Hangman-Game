## Welcome to Hangman Game!

This is a simple game of hangman as an exercise in object-oriented programming. The game currently runs from a short custom dictionary I made. The library we use is gtk 3, you can read more at: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/. Have fun with the game! If you have any improvements to suggest, please feel free to toss in a pull request.
