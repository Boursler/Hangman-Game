## Welcome to Hangman Game!

This is a simple game of hangman as an exercise in object-oriented programming which depends on the gtk 3 library. The game currently runs from a short custom dictionary I made. Have fun with the game! If you have any improvements to suggest, please feel free to toss in a pull request.
